# This automation is to control the Wemo smart plug that runs our air purifier.

# Air purifier has the following priority:
# 1. Should always run when the HVAC is running
# 2. Should always be on while windows are open
# 3. Should turn off when TV is playing
# 4. Should otherwise be on while we are home
# 5. While we are gone, should revert to a cycle depending on pollen count
